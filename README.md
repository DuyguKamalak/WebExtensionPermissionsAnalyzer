🧩 Browser Extension Permission Risk Analyzer

A security-focused tool that analyzes Chrome and Firefox browser extensions by inspecting their declared permissions, mapping them to risk levels, and generating human-readable security reports.

The goal is to make extension permission risks transparent, explainable, and actionable for both technical and non-technical users.

🚀 Overview
